# research-library

An archive of useful green software research resources.

This repository contains links with brief summary descriptions for various researech resources across the Green Software space.
Initially this is just markdown files, but eventually it can become a simple website.

Resources are broken down into:

- **papers**: peer reviewed research and pre-prints on green software topics.
- **blog posts and articles**: non-peer reviewed writing on green software topics
- **standards and protocols**: documentation and descriptions for measurement or accounting standards, protocols and methodologies in green software

For now we are simply listing in alphabetical order by the lead authors surname (with publication date as secondary criertion when there are name collisions). Later we may organize thematically.

## Listing criteria

The criteria is currently quite subjective - the PR reviewer will be from the GSF and will make a judgment about whether the resource is a) relevant to green software research, b) likely to be useful to the green software community. As the research library matures we will establisha  more formal process.

All resources listed must be open access or have an associated preprint. If it's paywalled, we won't list it.

## Contribute

Feel free to add resources by pull request. Please only submit resources that you consider to be of sufficiently high quality that people will want to refer to them 6 months from now.Social media posts typically will not be accepted. Please conform to the existing formatting.

Also, PRs that help maintain the library, e.g. replacing dead links, improving summary descriptions, etc are gratefully received.
