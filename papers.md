  - #### Summary

        Exploration of the trade-offs between model accuracy and energy consumption. The main findings are  that higher energy coinsumption does not always lead to higher accuracy.
        Quantized versions of models can be both more efficient and more accurate compared to full-precision versions of medium sized models. No single model is suitable for all tasks in software development.

  - #### Summary

        Scrutinizes the trends and trade-offs in scaling AI and refutes two common assumptions underlying the ‘bigger-is-better’ AI paradigm: 1) performance improvements result from increased scale, and 2) large-scale models are required to solve all interesting problems. The paper argues that approach is "fragile scientifically" and has negative externalities.
